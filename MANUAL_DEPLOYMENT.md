# Manual Deployment Guide for GSDashboard

## Environment Variables Setup

Since we're deploying to the existing Vercel project at https://gsdashboard-five.vercel.app/,
you need to set the following environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

### Required Environment Variables:

1. **BASE_URL**

   - Value: `https://gsdashboard-five.vercel.app`
   - Environment: Production

2. **API_URL**

   - Value: `https://gsdashboard-five.vercel.app/api`
   - Environment: Production

3. **NEXTAUTH_URL**

   - Value: `https://gsdashboard-five.vercel.app`
   - Environment: Production

4. **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**

   - Value: `gsdashboard_next_auth_secret_key_for_production_2024_secure_random_32chars`
   - Environment: Production
   - Note: This is a secure 64-character string for production use

5. **DATABASE_URL**

   - Value: `file:./dev.db`
   - Environment: Production
   - Note: For production, consider upgrading to PostgreSQL

6. **HOME_PATHNAME**

   - Value: `/dashboards/analytics`
   - Environment: Production

7. **NEXT_PUBLIC_HOME_PATHNAME**
   - Value: `/dashboards/analytics`
   - Environment: Production

## Steps to Deploy:

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "gsdashboard" project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable listed above for the "Production" environment
5. Go to Deployments tab
6. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### Option 2: Via GitHub Push (if connected)

1. Ensure your GitHub repository is connected to Vercel
2. Push this code to the main/master branch
3. Vercel will automatically deploy with the environment variables

### Option 3: Manual CLI Commands

If you have Vercel CLI access, run these commands:

```bash
# Set environment variables
vercel env add BASE_URL production
# Enter: https://gsdashboard-five.vercel.app

vercel env add API_URL production
# Enter: https://gsdashboard-five.vercel.app/api

vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL production
# Enter: https://gsdashboard-five.vercel.app

vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET production
# Enter: gsdashboard_next_auth_secret_key_for_production_2024_secure_random_32chars

vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
# Enter: file:./dev.db

vercel env add HOME_PATHNAME production
# Enter: /dashboards/analytics

vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_HOME_PATHNAME production
# Enter: /dashboards/analytics

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## Verification Steps:

1. Visit https://gsdashboard-five.vercel.app
2. Check that the dashboard loads properly
3. Test navigation between different pages
4. Verify authentication works (if using sign-in features)
5. Check that all components render correctly
6. Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Project Structure:

- The main application is in the `full-kit/` directory
- Build command: `pnpm vercel-build` (defined in root package.json)
- Output directory: `full-kit/.next`
- Framework: Next.js 15

## Important Notes:

- The project uses SQLite database (file:./dev.db) which is suitable for demo/development
- For production use, consider upgrading to PostgreSQL or another cloud database
- All authentication is handled via NextAuth.js with the configured secret
- The project includes internationalization (i18n) support

## Troubleshooting:

- If deployment fails, check Vercel deployment logs
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify the build process completes successfully
- Check that the DATABASE_URL is accessible
- Ensure NEXTAUTH_SECRET is exactly as specified (case-sensitive)
